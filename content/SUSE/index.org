Back in March, Christian Stankowic [[http://blog.christian-stankowic.de/?p=5862&lang=en][analysed Spacewalk 2.1 and its new user interface]] look and feel. He asked himself how
SUSE Manager would look like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I really appreciate this update! The new interface looks more clean
  and well-designed than the elderly look. I'm really interested to see
  what the implementation in SUSE Manager will look like and whether Red
  Hat Satellite will also get a new design.

Well, now you can see it yourself, as [[https://www.suse.com/company/press/2014/6/new-suse-manager-to-simplify-improve-linux-server-lifecycle-management.html][SUSE Manager 2.1 is out!]]

New features include, among others:

- A slick setup wizard to guide administrators through the basic steps
  needed to configure a fully operational SUSE Manager: Proxy, Novell
  Mirror Credentials, SUSE Products.

- Action chaining that lets administrators bundle and execute related
  management actions in one step
- Unattended bare-metal provisioning that allows customers to power on
  and off and reboot bare-metal systems via the IPMI (Intelligent
  Platform Management Interface) protocol.
- OpenScap (the open source implementation of SCAP -- Security Content
  Automation Protocol), a standardized approach to maintaining
  enterprise system security.
- CVE Auditing. This feature goes beyond telling you pending patches but
  instead assisting you to assign the right content to your
  systems: what vulnerabilities affect you where you haven't yet
  assigned the right channels. For example, you may have an affected
  system in production. CVE Auditing may tell you that you can fix the
  security issue by assigning the stage channel to a system.

- Locks packages on the server which are then enforced on the client
  side (eg. if you login via ssh to the client).

And of course, most of the work is [[https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/pulls][already merged upstream]].
